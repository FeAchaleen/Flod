Commercial Use License

Flod was a huge amount of work, and as such if you plan on using it in a commercial SWF the author requests you make a donation (minimum of $5) towards the project. "Commercial" means anything that is going to make money. This includes (but is not limited to): Flash games seeking sponsorship, Flash games with MochiAds / cpmStar / or any other form of advertising, games you will upload to Kongregate or NewGrounds (if it contains their ads API), and all forms of Flash work sold to clients  / publishers.

If your SWF will not directly earn you money (for example using it for music replay in a demo) then you are free to use it without paying.

To obtain a copy of your license please make your donation (minimum of $5) by PayPal to: chreil@hotmail.com - if possible include a link to your project. More for our interest in seeing how Flod is used than anything else. You will receive a license back by email.
